Module 07 — Q2: Types of tests and automation

Question
What types of tests should a tech lead champion?

Answer
- Unit, integration, component, contract, performance, and end-to-end tests. Build a test pyramid and automate where it provides the most value.

Example
`Module07Q2.java` shows a simple fake dependency.

Compile & run
```powershell
javac java_tech_lead\topics\Module07Q2\Module07Q2.java
java -cp java_tech_lead\topics\Module07Q2 Module07Q2
```
