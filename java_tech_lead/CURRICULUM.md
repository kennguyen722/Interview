Java Tech Lead Interview Prep - Curriculum

Recommended path (4 weeks suggested pacing):

Week 1 - Core Java & Concurrency
- Read `modules/01_java_core.md` and `modules/02_concurrency.md`.
- Implement and run corresponding examples.

Week 2 - JVM, Performance, and Testing
- Read `modules/03_jvm_memory.md`, `modules/06_performance.md`, `modules/07_testing.md`.
- Practice profiling and write microbenchmarks.

Week 3 - System Design & Architecture
- Read `modules/04_system_design.md` and `modules/05_architecture.md`.
- Sketch high-level designs; prepare trade-offs.

Week 4 - Leadership, Security, DBs, Reliability
- Read `modules/08_databases.md`, `modules/09_security.md`, `modules/10_leadership.md`.
- Practice behavioral answers, decision-making frameworks.

How to use:
- Study the Q&A for each module.
- Run the examples to show coding competence and to discuss trade-offs aloud.
- Record yourself explaining answers; refine for clarity and timing.

Notes:
- Each module contains 3 targeted interview questions with answers.
- Each question has a small Java example in `examples/` demonstrating a key point or implementation pattern.

Topics layout (per-question folders)

Each question now has a dedicated folder under `java_tech_lead/topics/ModuleXXQY/` with a `README.md` and a Java example. This makes it easier to study a single question end-to-end.

Quick commands

Compile all topic examples:

```powershell
javac java_tech_lead\topics\*\*.java
```

Run an example (from repo root):

```powershell
java -cp java_tech_lead\topics\Module01Q1 Module01Q1
```
