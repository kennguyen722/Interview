# Lesson 02: Request Mapping

## 1. Learning Objectives
- Understand Request Mapping fundamentals
- Apply Request Mapping in general scenarios
- Communicate trade-offs and best practices clearly

## 2. Why This Matters for a Java Tech Lead
A Tech Lead must evaluate, justify, and guide correct usage of Request Mapping ensuring reliability, performance, and maintainability across teams. Mastery enables mentoring and architectural judgment.

## 3. Core Theory
### 3.1 Key Concepts
This section presents the foundational concepts of request-mapping relevant to the general domain.
- Key definition
- Primary components
- Usage flow
- Constraints and trade-offs

### 3.2 Interview-Style Explanation
In interviews emphasize:
- Clarity of definition
- Production failure or success anecdote
- Trade-off awareness and when NOT to apply
- Performance or scalability angle

## 4. Code Examples
#### Example: Canonical Usage
Add domain-specific examples after enrichment pass.
Provide commentary explaining decisions, complexity, and alternatives.

## 5. Pitfalls and Best Practices
- Misunderstood concept boundary
- Common performance trap
- Incorrect assumption under load
- Testing oversight
- Security or reliability oversight
Guidance: Prefer measurable approaches, instrument early, document decisions.

## 6. Hands-On Exercises
### Exercise 1: Core Implementation
Goal: Demonstrate baseline request-mapping usage.
Acceptance: Clear, correct behavior.

### Exercise 2: Advanced Scenario
Goal: Extend solution with resilience/performance nuance.
Acceptance: Handles edge cases; basic metrics captured.

## 7. Interview Cheat Sheet
Definition: One-liner summarizing request-mapping.
When to Use: Ideal scenario conditions.
When to Avoid: Red flags and anti-pattern contexts.
Metrics: Observable indicators of success or failure.
Checklist: Design clarity, performance, testability, resilience.
