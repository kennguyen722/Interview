## Q1 Answer
HashMap + doubly linked list supports O(1) access & eviction.
## Q2 Answer
Check mid calculation & loop boundaries; print indices on failure.
## Q3 Answer
Early break reduces worst-case iterations; still O(n*m) for nested loops unless pruned.
## Q4 Answer
Heap maintains median via two heaps; tree offers order but higher update cost.
## Q5 Answer
Iterative avoids stack overflow & reduces function call overhead.
## Q6 Answer
== compares references; use equals() to check logical equality.
## Q7 Answer
Detect overflow via pre-check (if a > MAX - b); or use long cast.
## Q8 Answer
Reuse buffers or preallocate arrays to minimize GC churn.
