1. (MCQ) Choose best DS for LRU cache - why?
2. (Scenario) Off-by-one bug in binary search - debugging approach.
3. (Complexity) Derive complexity for nested loop with early break.
4. (Data) Pick heap vs balanced tree for median stream - justify.
5. (Optimization) Turn recursive DFS into iterative - benefit?
6. (Pitfall) Using == for string equality - impact.
7. (Edge Case) Strategy for integer overflow detection in addition.
8. (Performance) Technique to reduce allocations in tight loop.
