# Exercises: Primitive vs Reference Types
1. Demonstrate difference between `==` and `.equals` on `Integer` cache and non-cache values.
2. Write a loop summing 1..1_000_000 using `Integer` and using `int`; measure time.
3. Create a method that safely compares two possibly-null `Long` values.
4. Refactor code with repeated boxing to use primitive streams.
5. Show a failing case of unboxing null and fix it.
