# Exercises: Overloading vs Overriding
1. Create ambiguous overloads with `print(null)`; resolve using casts.
2. Demonstrate widening vs boxing precedence with multiple overloads.
3. Implement covariant return example with base and derived types.
4. Show static method hiding vs instance overriding difference.
5. Benchmark primitive vs wrapper overload invocation in a loop.
