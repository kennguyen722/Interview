03-spring / 01-core

Covers Spring Core concepts: IoC container, DI, bean scopes, lifecycle, configuration, and profiles.

Prompts include: @Component/@Bean, @Configuration, bean scopes, lifecycle events, and more.

I can add code examples showing a small Spring Boot application and unit tests if you want.
