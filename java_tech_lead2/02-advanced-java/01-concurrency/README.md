02-advanced-java / 01-concurrency

This folder will cover advanced concurrency topics: threads, executor services, locks, atomics, latches, semaphores, and common concurrency patterns.

Prompts include (from the prompt pack):
- Prompt 251: concurrency vs parallelism
- Prompt 252: Thread creation
- Prompt 253: Callable vs Runnable
- ... and more (see course pack)

Use `templates/ExerciseTemplate.java` to create exercises. When you're ready I can populate this folder with worked examples per prompt.
