# Detailed Lecture Notes - Lesson 11.4: Capstone Build Sprint 3

## Lesson Context
- Module: Capstone and Interview Readiness (Weeks 31-32)
- Primary topics: Deployment, scale testing, hardening
- Target output: Production-style release candidate
- Pace: Slow and incremental, with validation after each step

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand all core terms before coding.
2. Build one working path from input to output.
3. Add validation and error handling.
4. Refactor for readability and maintainability.
5. Explain the solution as if teaching a beginner.

## First-Time Terms and Definitions
- **Deployment**: Deployment is a key concept in this lesson.
- **scale testing**: scale testing is a key concept in this lesson.
- **hardening**: hardening is a key concept in this lesson.

## Slow-Paced Teaching Flow
1. Concept brief (what and why)
- Explain the problem in plain language.
- Identify inputs, transformations, and outputs.
2. Minimal implementation
- Implement the smallest working solution.
- Run immediately and inspect output.
3. Validation layer
- Add constraints and handle invalid states.
- Re-run and verify behavior with edge cases.
4. Professional improvement
- Extract methods, clarify names, remove duplication.
- Add comments only where logic is non-obvious.
5. Reflection
- Summarize trade-offs and next improvements.

## Annotated Demonstration
```java
public class LessonDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Start from explicit input values
        String raw = "lesson-input";

        // Step 2: Validate early to keep behavior safe
        if (raw == null || raw.isBlank()) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input");
            return;
        }

        // Step 3: Apply core lesson transformation
        String result = raw.trim().toUpperCase();

        // Step 4: Produce deterministic output
        System.out.println("Output: " + result);
    }
}
```

## Practice Checklist
- [ ] I can explain each term without notes.
- [ ] I ran the demo code and changed one behavior.
- [ ] I added one validation case and tested it.
- [ ] I can explain how this lesson supports full-stack development.
